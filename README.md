# Face-Detection-only
//This is a project for detecting face in image or in live video.
WE gonna use Open Cv for detecting face in images..
//
//Just Importing file and libraries.......................
Step:-1
1. open your favarote IDE for pyhton and make file called abcd.py
2. open this file in coding/writting mode
3. Import opencv
4. There is also an attachment of Haarcascade file, It containe the programe and data about face geussture..
5. In a variable store this file..

//Taking Input via webcam or local file and changing it's pixel and scale...

Step:-2
1. Open your webcam (If you want to make it live detection) or give the path of image that you want to detect the face.. and save it into another variable.
2. Chane the image from BGR to Gray scale image...and save it into another image_variable
3. Now on that gray scaled image fetch data from Haarcascade file.. and save it into another image type var.

//Now time to do magic........

Step:-3
--draw a rectangle in your faverote color in that image which is fatched from haarcased and gray scale image (Step:-2, line 3 , variable).
And after detecting open a new window to show output(if it live) or save that image in local file.
And in the end close all windows...
